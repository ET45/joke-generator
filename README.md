## 🎯 What is JokeGen?

**JokeGenie** is a playful and beautifully animated joke generator that lets users:
- Choose a category of humor (Dad Jokes, Country Humor, Dark Humor)
- Enter an optional topic (e.g. “bananas”, “JavaScript”, “your mom”)
- Click a button or a category and receive an AI-generated joke, instantly 🎤

### 🧩 KendoReact Components
- `@progress/kendo-react-buttons`  
- `@progress/kendo-react-inputs`  
- `@progress/kendo-react-layout`  
- `@progress/kendo-react-indicators`  
- `@progress/kendo-react-notification`  

These gave me a powerful base UI to work from while allowing full customization to match a fun, playful aesthetic.

### 🧠 GenAI: Cohere’s Command R+
